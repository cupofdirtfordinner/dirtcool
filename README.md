# dirtcool
finally making dirtcool, again, again. 

hey gamers, my name is dirt/cupofdirtfordinner. Basically my school blocked all the good unblocked game websites, so i made my own shitty one. i told some friends, it got semi popular at my school, and then I decided to captialize and try running ads. problem was that i made the website in google sites, so i couldnt run any ads without risk of my google account(s) getting deleted. So my best alternative was to rewrite the entire website from scratch. Im goin for a 90s-ish vibe so i dont have to put "effort" and "care" into this. The goal is to get this done before the 27th, because my domain expired and i didnt realise until 2 months late so i would have to pay a $100 fee to restore the domain before it enters the public market. im not paying that, so im just waiting for the 27th and buying it for the regular price. anyways im gonna go make a mockery of computer science in its entirety by continuing this project, pretending as if i know what im doing, and maybe it will turn out half decent.
